## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

Place the script in a folder where you want results saved.

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python EcomScraper.py
```

On the first run, it will:

* Ask if you'd like to generate keywords from Google autocomplete
* Create a `keywords.txt` file with sample keywords
* Create a `blacklist.txt` with default domains to exclude
* Prompt you for configuration (saved in `config.json`)

### 3. Choose Your Keywords

* You can **manually enter keywords** in `keywords.txt`, or
* **Automatically generate them** by entering a seed keyword (e.g., "gaming mouse") and a limit (up to 500). The tool will fetch autocomplete suggestions and write them to `keywords.txt`.

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.

### 4. Edit `blacklist.txt` (Optional)

Add domains to exclude from results (e.g., Amazon, Walmart):

```
amazon.com
ebay.com
```

### 5. Configure the Tool (First Run or On Demand)

You‚Äôll be prompted to input:

* Path to keyword file
* Number of Google results per keyword
* HTTP request timeout
* Delay between searches
* Max number of keywords to use
* Proxy (optional)

If `config.json` already exists, you'll be asked if you want to update it.
Current values will be shown for reference.

## üìÑ Output Files

* Results are saved in `/results` as:

  ```
  <keyword>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt
  ```
* Each file contains deduplicated, valid e-commerce domains with their source URLs

---

## üîê Proxy Support

To avoid Google rate limits, you can use a proxy:

* Format: `user:pass@host:port` or `ip:port`
* Leave blank to skip

The tool also implements retry logic for Google‚Äôs 429 errors (Too Many Requests) with a cooldown and retry limit.
